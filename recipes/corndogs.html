        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I love the corn dogs you buy at carnivals but wanted to make them at home so I created this easy batter for frankfurters. Great served with mustard.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cornmeal and flour: This corn dog batter starts with yellow cornmeal and all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li>Sugar: A pinch of sugar lends a hint of sweetness.</li>
            <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the batter rise.</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper: Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Milk: A cup of milk adds moisture, ensuring a tender coating.</li>
            <li>Egg: An egg gives the batter even more moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the batter together.</li>
            <li>Oil: Fry the corn dogs in a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>Beef frankfurters: This recipe calls for beef frankfurters, but you can use pork franks (or hot dogs) if you'd prefer.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the batter by combining the dry ingredients, then stirring in the milk and egg.</li>
            <li>Skewer the frankfurters and roll in the batter.</li>
            <li>Fry the corn dogs in hot oil until lightly browned.</li>
        </ol>
