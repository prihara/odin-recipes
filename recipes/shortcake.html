        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Blueberries sandwiched between homemade shortcake topped with cream - blueberry shortcake is the perfect summer dessert.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Vanilla extract: The simple shortcakes start with vanilla extract mixed with heavy whipping cream.</li>
            <li>Heavy whipping cream: You’ll need heavy whipping cream for shortcakes and for the whipped cream. </li>
            <li>Egg: An egg lends moisture and helps bind the shortcake batter together.</li>
            <li>Lemon: Lemon zest brightens up the shortcakes, while lemon juice adds flavor to the blueberry topping.</li>
            <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the shortcake batter structure.</li>
            <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cakes rise.</li>
            <li>Sugar: Granulated sugar goes into the shortcakes and the blueberry topping, while powdered sugar is essential for homemade whipped cream.</li>
            <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the blueberry shortcakes, but it won’t make them taste salty.</li>
            <li>Butter: Butter adds moisture and richness to the shortcakes.</li>
            <li>Blueberries: Of course, you’ll need blueberries! Fresh is best, but frozen berries will work just fine.</li>
        </ul>
